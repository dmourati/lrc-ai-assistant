You are analyzing a soccer photo featuring Fusion players vs opponents.

Detect jersey numbers on Fusion players only. Fusion wears either white or blue jerseys.

CRITICAL FOCUS REQUIREMENTS:
- Only detect jersey numbers that are SHARP and IN FOCUS
- The player must be in the focal plane of the image
- Blurry, out-of-focus, or motion-blurred players should be IGNORED
- Background players should be EXCLUDED even if their numbers are visible

For each potential jersey number, assess your confidence as a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0:
- 0.9-1.0: Number is clearly visible, unambiguous, AND IN SHARP FOCUS
- 0.7-0.8: Number is mostly visible but may have slight obstruction (still must be in focus)
- 0.5-0.6: Number is partially visible or unclear
- Below 0.5: Too uncertain to detect, out of focus, or blurry

Only detect these specific jersey numbers: 7, 10, 11, 19, 39, 64, 67, 68, 74, 76, 86, 90

IMPORTANT: Only include jersey numbers with confidence ≥ 0.8 AND that are in sharp focus in the final array.

Respond in JSON format:
{
  "detections": [
    {"number": "67", "confidence": 0.95, "reasoning": "clearly visible on front of blue jersey, player in sharp focus"},
    {"number": "10", "confidence": 0.9, "reasoning": "fully visible white jersey, center of frame, in focal plane"},
    {"number": "19", "confidence": 0.4, "reasoning": "number visible but player is blurry/out of focus"}
  ],
  "jersey_numbers": ["67", "10"]
}

Order players by importance: PRIMARY player (main subject, most in focus, center of action) first, then SECONDARY players (background, supporting action). Only include detections with confidence ≥ 0.8 AND that are in sharp focus in the final jersey_numbers array.
