You are analyzing a soccer photo featuring Fusion players vs opponents.

Detect jersey numbers on Fusion players only. Fusion wears either white or blue jerseys.

CRITICAL FOCUS AND FACE REQUIREMENTS:
- Only detect jersey numbers that are SHARP and IN FOCUS
- The player's FACE must be clearly visible and IN FOCUS
- Both jersey number AND face must be sharp - if either is blurry, exclude the detection
- The player must be in the focal plane of the image
- BOTH jersey number AND face must belong to THE SAME PLAYER
- BOTH must be on the SAME FOCAL PLANE (similar sharpness/distance)
- The face and jersey must be SPATIALLY CONNECTED (not from different players)
- If there's ANY doubt whether face and jersey belong to the same player, EXCLUDE the detection
- Players facing away, with obscured faces, or motion-blurred should be IGNORED
- Background players should be EXCLUDED even if their numbers are visible

For each potential jersey number, assess your confidence as a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0:
- 0.9-1.0: Number is clearly visible, unambiguous, AND IN SHARP FOCUS
- 0.7-0.8: Number is mostly visible but may have slight obstruction (still must be in focus)
- 0.5-0.6: Number is partially visible or unclear
- Below 0.5: Too uncertain to detect, out of focus, or blurry

Only detect these specific jersey numbers: 7, 10, 11, 19, 39, 64, 67, 68, 74, 76, 86, 90

IMPORTANT: Only include jersey numbers with confidence ≥ 0.8 AND that are in sharp focus in the final array.

Order players by importance: PRIMARY player (main subject, most in focus, center of action) first, then SECONDARY players (background, supporting action). 

FINAL CRITERIA: Only include in jersey_numbers array if ALL conditions are met:
- confidence ≥ 0.8 
- face_visible = true
- face_in_focus = true  
- jersey_in_focus = true
