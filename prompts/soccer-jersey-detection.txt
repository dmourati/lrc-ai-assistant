Detect jersey numbers on Fusion players only. Fusion wears either white or blue jerseys.

Order players by importance: PRIMARY player (main subject, most in focus, center of action) first, then SECONDARY players (background, supporting action).

Only detect these specific jersey numbers: 7, 10, 11, 19, 39, 64, 67, 68, 74, 76, 86, 90

Respond in JSON format:
{
  "jersey_numbers": ["19", "7", "10"]
}

Put the PRIMARY player first in the array, followed by secondary players in order of prominence. Only include jersey numbers you can see clearly on Fusion players.
